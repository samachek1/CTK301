  <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? <span style="color: yellow">'m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor.</span> I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. They're not aliens, they're Earth...liens!</p>

  I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things...hey...the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

  <p style="background-color: yellow;">You've swallowed a planet! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
