<h2>Sam and his Shoes</h2>

<p>My name is Sam and I am a sophomore here at ISU. Majoring in Audio and Music Production with a minor in finance. During my time in highschool I decided that I wanted to start customizing shoes. Within this site I have my first three pieces of art that I made. While rough and inconsistent at times, you can still see the amount of time and energy put into the three pairs of shoes. Since this time I have made considerable improvements ranging from the consistency of paint strokes to the coordination of colors and designs. My reasoning behind creating these pairs of shoes in particular were pretty simple, at the time of my designing these shoes I was in lockdown for Covid. During this part of my life I had plenty of time to do things I didn't have time to do before, one of which was to read and watch the famous anime called One piece. You can see the creation of my Sanji x Trafalgar Law shoes is most certainly inspired by the aforementioned anime and manga called One Piece. The right shoe is inspired by the chef of the crew in the aforementioned anime and the left shoe is inspired by a powerful ally to the main crew in One Piece. The second pair of shoes was the only pair that I sought out instructions for as I wanted to see how I would fair following directions as opposed to creating my own unique design. Hence, the red cartoon shoes. The third and final pair of shoes that is displayed on this site contains shades of red and pink. At this point in time during my time in highschool I had decided that I wanted to make a shoe that would pop with color. And this I achieved with the red shaded shoe. Since this time I have designed many other shoes and plan on continuing to perfect my craft. Overall these first three pairs displayed have significant room for improvement and I intend to more accurately show my art in the future.
